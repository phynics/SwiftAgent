    function_name: filesystem
    
    ## Description
    `filesystem` is a utility for performing file system operations in a controlled and safe manner. It ensures that all operations are restricted to the specified working directory and supports the following functionalities:
    - Reading file contents as UTF-8 text.
    - Writing text data to files.
    - Listing directory contents.
    
    ### Key Features
    - Enforces path safety to prevent access outside the working directory.
    - Operates on files and directories within the defined workspace.
    - Prevents access to system-critical files.
    
    ### Limitations
    - Binary file operations are not supported.
    - Access outside the working directory is disallowed.
    - Cannot modify system files.
    
    ## Parameters
    ### Required Parameters
    - **operation**:
      - **Type**: `String`
      - **Description**: The type of operation to perform. Valid values are:
        - `"read"`: Read the contents of a file.
        - `"write"`: Write text data to a file.
    - **path**:
      - **Type**: `String`
      - **Description**: The relative path to the target file or directory.
      - **Requirements**: Must be within the working directory.
    
    ### Optional Parameters
    - **content** (only for `write` operation):
      - **Type**: `String`
      - **Description**: The text content to write to the file.
    
    ## Usage
    ### General Guidelines
    - Always provide a valid relative path for the `path` parameter.
    - Ensure that the `content` parameter is provided when performing a `write` operation.
    - Use UTF-8 encoded text for file contents.
    - Avoid attempting operations on paths outside the working directory.
    
    ### Common Scenarios
    1. **Reading a File**: Ensure the target file exists and contains UTF-8 encoded text.
    2. **Writing to a File**: The file will be created if it does not exist, and its content will be overwritten.
    
    ## Examples
    
    ### Example 1: Read a File
    ```json
    {
      "operation": "read",
      "path": "documents/report.txt"
    }
    ```
    **Expected Output**:
    ```json
    {
      "success": true,
      "content": "This is the content of the file.",
      "metadata": {
        "operation": "read",
        "path": "documents/report.txt",
        "size": "28"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    ### Example 2: Write to a File
    ```json
    {
      "operation": "write",
      "path": "notes/todo.txt",
      "content": "Buy groceries\nCall the doctor"
    }
    ```
    **Expected Output**:
    ```json
    {
      "success": true,
      "content": "File written successfully",
      "metadata": {
        "operation": "write",
        "path": "notes/todo.txt",
        "size": "32"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    ### Example 3: Attempt to Access an Unsafe Path
    ```json
    {
      "operation": "read",
      "path": "../../etc/passwd"
    }
    ```
    **Expected Output**:
    ```json
    {
      "success": false,
      "content": "Path is not within working directory: ../../etc/passwd",
      "metadata": {
        "operation": "read",
        "error": "Path is not within working directory: ../../etc/passwd"
      }
    }
    ```
